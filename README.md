# Interactive Hierarchy Editor

This is a quick side project I did to experiment with using D3 layouts (the partition layout in particular),
not for the visualization of a pre-existing dataset, but as the basis for an interactive tool.

You can read more about the project on [my portfolio](http://alex.holachek.com/ux/hierarchy-editor.html).

The file structure is complex because it was originally generated by yeoman when I was attempting to do a small project in React,
but then I got distracted by D3 and was too lazy to prune the project.
